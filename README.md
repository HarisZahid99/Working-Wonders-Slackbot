## Inspiration

#### As a team, we wanted to help promote better workplace relationships and connections--especially since the workplace has been virtual for so long. To achieve this, we created a slack bot to increase the engagement between coworkers through various activities or experiences that can be shared among each other. This will allow team members to form more meaningful relationships which create a better work environment overall. Slack is a great tool for an online work platform and can be used better to increase social connections while also being effective for communicating goals for a team.
