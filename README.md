# Working Wonders slackbot
#### Winner of Best use of echoAR at UottaHacks2021 :)


## Inspiration
As a team, we wanted to help promote better workplace relationships and connections--especially since the workplace has been virtual for so long. To achieve this, we created a slack bot to increase the engagement between coworkers through various activities or experiences that can be shared among each other. This will allow team members to form more meaningful relationships which create a better work environment overall. Slack is a great tool for an online work platform and can be used better to increase social connections while also being effective for communicating goals for a team.

## What it does
When the Slackbot is added to a workplace on slack, the team is capable of accessing various commands. The commands are used with the / prefix. Some of the commands include:
- `help`: To get help
- `game-help` : To get game help
- `game-skribble` : Provides a link to a skribble.io game
- `game-chess` : Provides a link to a chess game
- `game-codenames` : Provides a link to a codenames game
- `game-uno` : Provides a link to a UNO game
- `game-monopoly` : Provides a link to a COVID-19 themed monopoly game
- `memes` :Generates randomized memes (for conversation starters with colleagues)
- `virtual-escape` : Allows users to see art, monuments, museums, etc (randomized QR codes) through augments reality for a short "virtual escape"
- `mystery`: Displays a mystery of the month for colleagues to enjoy and talk about amongst each other

We also have scheduled messages that we incorporated to help automate some processes in the workplace such as:
- `birthday reminders` : Used to send an automated message to the channel when it is someone's birthday
- `mystery` : Sends out the mystery of the month at beginning of each month

## How we built it 
The Bot was designed using the SlackAPI and programmed using python. Using the SlackAPI commands the bot was programmed to increase social interaction and incite more conversations during the Covid-19 remote working regulation. The bot has a variety of commands to help workers engage in conversations with their fellow colleagues. With a wide selection of virtual games to be played during lunch breaks or perhaps take a short relaxing break using the EchoAR generated QR Codes to devel into the world of augmented reality and admire or play with what they are as shown. Workers are also able to request a singular meme from the bot and enjoy a short laugh or spark a funny conversation with others who also see the meme. Overall, the bot was built with the mindset of further enhancing social communication in a fun manner to help those working remotely feel more at ease.
